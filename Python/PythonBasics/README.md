# PythonBasics
7 Programs in Python for beginners.

# (1) sum.py
Create a python program for accepting two integer inputs and return their product if the sum of two numbers is greater than 20 and less than 40; else return the difference if their sum is greater than 40 and less than 60 and return their sum if their sum is greater than 60. 

# (2) marks.py
Write a python program to input 5 subject marks and calculate total marks, percentage and grade based on following criteria:
• Percentage less than 35 (Grade F)
• percentage greater than or equal to 35 and less than 65 (Grade C)
• percentage greater than or equal to 65 and less than 85 (Grade B)
• percentage greater than or equal to 85 (Grade A) 

# (3) shapes.py
Write a python program to accept a shape as an input. Then according to the shape provided as an input, take the necessary parameters as input and return the perimeter and the area of the shape.

# (4) palindrome.py
Write a python program to check whether a given number is palindrome or not. Also reverse the number and print the output.

# (5) pattern.py
Using python print the following pattern as output:
1
2 1
4 2 1
8 4 2 1
16 8 4 2 1
32 16 8 4 2 1
64 32 16 8 4 2 1
128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
The above pattern is the answer when the value of n is 8. Take user input and create a similar pattern for value of n as 5 and 7.

# (6) strings.py
Create a List containing 10 random strings. Sort the list in both ascending and descending order and print the output. Reverse all the strings in the list and display the result?

# (7) dictionary.py
Construct a dictionary for storing Student information. The dictionary should have ‘studentId’ as key and ‘studentName’ , ‘studentRollNo’, ‘studentAge’, and the last element will be a list containing marks of students in 5 subjects. Your task is to populate this dictionary with at least 10 entries and display all the information about the students with Highest and lowest marks. Also calculate the average marks scored by all the students and display the information of students scoring above average marks. At last, sort the dictionary by the ‘studentName’ and display the result.
